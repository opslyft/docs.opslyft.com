# Budget Management

In this section, we will walk you through the process of viewing existing budgets and creating new ones using the Budget Dashboard. With this feature, you can proactively monitor your expenses and make informed decisions to stay within your financial goals.

## Accessing the Budget Dashboard

The Budget Dashboard serves as your central hub for tracking budgets and financial health. Here, you can find a list of active budgets and an informative visual representation of budget health. Key information, such as potential budget exceedance and pertinent budget details, is readily available. If you require a more detailed understanding of why a budget has exceeded or need additional insights, simply click on the specific budget to explore further.

## Investigating Exceedances

When a budget surpasses its threshold, you can swiftly identify the sources of the overage. For example, there might be multiple sources contributing to an S3 budget exceedance. By navigating to the "Sources of Exceedance" section, you can gain a breakdown of the contributing factors and receive actionable advice on how to realign the budget. The platform presents a "Cost Trend versus Budget Amount" graph to help you visualize the trend and take informed actions.

## Creating a New Budget

1. To establish a new budget, click the "Create New Budget" button located in the top right corner of the Budget Dashboard.
2. As this feature supports multiple Cloud providers, you can select the ones that apply to your use case. For instance, you can opt for AWS and Azure simultaneously.
3. Utilize filters to tailor your budget view according to your preferences.
4. Proceed to enter the necessary budget details:

   - Budget amount
   - Budget name (customizable)
   - Start date of the budget
   - Optional growth rate for the budget amount

5. Gain a comprehensive preview of your selected options before moving forward.

## Budget Alerts

Budget alerts play a crucial role in helping you manage your costs effectively by providing timely notifications. You can configure these alerts to notify you when your actual expenses approach or exceed predefined thresholds, ensuring that you receive prompt updates and can take timely action.

Budget alerts serve as an early warning system, helping you proactively manage your cloud costs and prevent unexpected overages. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up and customizing budget alerts to suit your organization's needs.

## Configuring Alerts

Stay informed about your budget status by configuring alerts:

1. Set up alerts to trigger when the actual forecasted cost exceeds a specified percentage of the budget amount.
2. Add multiple alerts to cater to different thresholds and requirements.
3. Choose recipients for alerts, including individuals and Slack channels, ensuring the right stakeholders are notified promptly.

![Cloud Optimization](/img/providers1.png)

1. **Access Your Account:** Access your OpsLyft account by logging in with your credentials or signing up if you're new to OpsLyft.
2. **Select Your Cloud Provider:**
   - **For New Users:** If you're new to OpsLyft and haven't integrated any accounts before, you'll find options to integrate accounts right on the landing page when you access your account. Select the cloud provider you want to integrate, and follow the integration steps.
   - **For Existing Users Adding a New Account:** If you already have an account integrated and want to add a new one, navigate to "Accounts" settings and click the "Connect New Account" button located on the upper right corner of your page. Specify whether it's a linked account or not, and select the required cloud provider from the supported options that appear.
3. **Follow Integration Steps:** OpsLyft will guide you through the integration steps, which typically involve providing necessary credentials and permissions for the integration.
4. **Verify Integration:** After completing the integration steps, verify that your cloud provider is successfully connected to OpsLyft.

Repeat this process for each cloud provider you want to integrate. Once connected, you'll have a centralized view of your multi-cloud environment within OpsLyft.
